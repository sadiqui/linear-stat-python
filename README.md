# Linear Stats

This Python program reads data from a file and calculates two key statistics: the **Linear Regression Line** and the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**. The data file contains one value per line, which represents the y-values of a graph, while the x-values are the line numbers (starting from 0).

The program expects the data to be provided in a file where each line contains a single number, like this:

```
189
113
121
114
145
110
...
```

Example of the program output:

```
Linear Regression Line: y = 3.456789x + 1.234567
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.9876543210
```

## Concepts
